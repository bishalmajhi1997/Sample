#Github:Q1. What is GitHub Repository?
#Answer:

#First, we try to understand the repository sharing which stores our project code. We can refer to our latest code from there. This can be created by our referee as the local folder on your computer. Also, it can be referring as the storage space on the github, where we can keep our files, text, directory, or images any kind of files. For this, we have to first create the repository on the GitHub.
