                    <h3>What is c++?</h3>
                </header>
                <p>C++ (pronounced "C plus plus") is a general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer
                    scientist Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The
                    language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and
                    functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always
                    implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free
                    Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on
                    many platforms.[10]

                    C++ was designed with systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large
                    systems in mind, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights.[11]
                    C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software
                    infrastructure and resource-constrained applications,[11] including desktop applications, video
                    games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical applications
                    (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).[12]

                    C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest
                    standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2020 as ISO/IEC 14882:2020 (informally
                    known as C++20).[13] The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC
                    14882:1998, which was then amended by the C++03, C++11, C++14, and C++17 standards. The current
                    C++20 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library. Before the
                    initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an
                    extension of the C language; he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also
                    provided high-level features for program organization.[14] Since 2012, C++ has been on a three-year
                    release schedule[15] with C++23 as the next planned standard.[16]

                    <h3>Objects and Classes</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Class is a detailed description, the definition, and the template of what an object will be. But it
                    is not the object itself. Also, what we call, a class is the building block that leads to
                    Object-Oriented Programming. It is a user-defined data type, that holds its own data members and
                    member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. It is the
                    blueprint of any object. Once we have written a class and defined it, we can use it to create as
                    many objects based on that class as we want. In Java, the class contains fields, constructors, and
                    methods. For example, consider the Class of Accounts. There may be many accounts with different
                    names and types, but all of them will share some common properties, as all of them will have some
                    common attributes like balance, account holder name, etc. So here, the Account is the class.

                    Object is an instance of a class. All data members and member functions of the class can be accessed
                    with the help of objects. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated, but memory is allocated
                    when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created). For Example, considering the objects for the
                    class Account are SBI Account, ICICI account, etc.

                    <h3>Inheritance</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Inheritance is a feature or a process in which, new classes are created from the existing classes.
                    The new class created is called “derived class” or “child class” and the existing class is known as
                    the “base class” or “parent class”. The derived class now is said to be inherited from the base
                    class.

                    When we say derived class inherits the base class, it means, the derived class inherits all the
                    properties of the base class, without changing the properties of base class and may add new features
                    to its own. These new features in the derived class will not affect the base class. The derived
                    class is the specialized class for the base class.

                    Sub Class: The class that inherits properties from another class is called Subclass or Derived
                    Class.
                    Super Class: The class whose properties are inherited by a subclass is called Base Class or
                    Superclass.

                    <h3>Polymorphism</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Polymorphism in Java is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways.
                    Polymorphism is derived from 2 Greek words: poly and morphs. The word "poly" means many and "morphs"
                    means forms. So polymorphism means many forms.

                    There are two types of polymorphism in Java: compile-time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism. We
                    can perform polymorphism in java by method overloading and method overriding.

                    If you overload a static method in Java, it is the example of compile time polymorphism. Here, we
                    will focus on runtime polymorphism in java.

                    Runtime Polymorphism in Java
                    Runtime polymorphism or Dynamic Method Dispatch is a process in which a call to an overridden method
                    is resolved at runtime rather than compile-time.

                    <h3>Abstraction</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Abstraction is the act of representing essential features without including the background
                    details. Data abstraction involves giving the outside environment only the key facts about the
                    data while hiding the background specifics or explanations. In C++, classes provide a great
                    level of data abstraction.

                    Introduction
                    They expose enough public methods to the outside environment to allow users to experiment with
                    the object’s functionality and manipulate its data.

                    For instance, a state without recognizing how the class is implemented internally. The pow()
                    function, for example, is used to measure the power of a number without understanding the
                    algorithm it uses.

                    In reality, the sorting functions underlying functionality can change between library releases.
                    Your function call will still operate so long as the interface remains the same.

                    This article will go through an introduction to abstraction along with types and how data
                    abstraction is achieved in C++.

                    <h3>Encapsulation</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Encapsulation brings together the data and the methods that manipulate the data into a single
                    component and protects them from outside interference. In essence, encapsulation involves bundling
                    the data as well as the functions that use the data. Data encapsulation in lead to the very
                    important concept of data hiding.

                    Encapsulation in C++ is implemented using classes that are user defined data types. These classes
                    contain data types as well as methods that are bound together.

                    A program that represents encapsulation in C++ using classes is given as follows.
