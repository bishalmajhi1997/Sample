            <p class="bold"> (/ˈhaɪdərəbæd/ (listen) HY-dər-ə-bad;[6]
                Telugu: [ˈɦaɪ̯daraːbaːd], Urdu:
                [ˈɦɛːdəɾaːbaːd]) is the capital and largest city of the Indian state of Telangana and the de jure
                capital of
                Andhra Pradesh.[A] It occupies 650 km2 (250 sq mi) on the Deccan Plateau along the banks of the Musi
                River,
                in the northern part of Southern India. With an average altitude of 542 m (1,778 ft), much of Hyderabad
                is
                situated on hilly terrain around artificial lakes, including the Hussain Sagar lake, predating the
                city's
                founding, in the north of the city centre. According to the 2011 Census of India, Hyderabad is the
                fourth-most populous city in India with a population of 6.9 million residents within the city limits,
                and
                has a population of 9.7 million residents in the metropolitan region, making it the sixth-most populous

            <p class="bold">
                Relics of the Qutb Shahi and Nizam eras remain visible today; the Charminar has come to symbolise the
                city. By the end of the early modern era, the Mughal Empire had declined in the Deccan, and the Nizam's
                patronage attracted men of letters from various parts of the world. A distinctive culture arose from the
                amalgamation of local and migrated artisans, with Painting, handicraft, jewellery, literature, dialect
                and clothing are prominent still today. Through its cuisine, the city is listed as a creative city of
                gastronomy by UNESCO. The Telugu film industry based in the city was the country's second-largest
                producer of motion pictures as of 2012.

            <p>Located by the side of Hussain Sagar Lake, Sanjeevaiah Park enjoys a prime location, at the centre of the
                city. Named after the former Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Damodaram Sanjivayya, this park is
                maintained by the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority. Initially there were plans to connect
                Sanjeevaiah Park to Lumbini Park, which is located on the other side of the lake through an aerial
                tramway. However, later the proposal wasn’t approved. A popular tourist spot, this park also has the
                fame of receiving the Best Open Landscape Award in 2010, under the category of Indian National Trust for
                Art and Cultural Heritage. It is also known to be one of the largest and the oldest parks in Hyderabad.
